# Event Delegation in JavaScript
Event delegation in JS is an important subject especially for front-end developers, however few know why and when to apply it.

__What is an event?__

In real life an event is a specific action which takes place at a certain moment or time.

In __JavaScript__ events are actions which happen when a user is interacting with a webpage, a component in mobile apps, or when a change happens in a background script. Examples of events are click, scroll, keypress, change etc.

Though events are a wide topic, it's one of the most important basics a serious developer should learn about despite the programming language. I recommend to [go here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) to read about JavaScript events and [go here](https://medium.com/@bretdoucette/part-4-what-is-event-delegation-in-javascript-f5c8c0de2983) to read about __Events delegation__

## Use case: Repeater elements(fields)
